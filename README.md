Elgar: *A simple flashlight application.*
=========================================

Elgar is flashlight application for android that applies good design concepts to a simple program. While a flaslight
application might be one of the simpler peices of software a user may ever use, it's a exceedingly helpful utility that may
be used on a daily bases. For that reason, we belive that it deserves the full scrunity of a well thought out design.

**Design Concepts Highlights**

* Application automaticly closes when the user locks their device.
* Light turns on at application lanuch.
* No buttons, settings, or features to accidently activate or confuse user.
* Low lumosity interface reduces light shined into users eyes from device screen.

**Why a dollar?**

$0.99 USD is the lowest Google will allow developers to price the applications (8/20/2013). Also, an ad based model does 
not allow for a low lumosity interface which is part of what we consider good design for a flashlight application.

Many users are bombarded with addvertisments on a daily basis, and weather they beliuve it or not this does effect many of
their buying habbits. A paid software model allows our users to escape from ads, and can be a better alternative when the
price is fair and low.

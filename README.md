Elgar: *A simple flashlight application.*
=========================================

Elgar is flashlight application for android that applies good design concepts to a simple program. While a flashlight
application might be one of the simpler pieces of software a user may ever use, it's an exceedingly helpful utility that 
may be used on a daily basis. For that reason, we believe that it deserves the full scrutiny of a well thought out design.

**Design Concepts Highlights**

* Application automatically closes when the user locks their device.
* Light turns on at application launch.
* No buttons, settings, or features to accidentally activate or confuse user.
* Low luminosity interface reduces light shined into users eyes from device screen.

**Why a dollar?**

$0.99 USD is the lowest Google will allow developers to price the applications (8/20/2013). Also, an ad based model does 
not allow for a low luminosity interface which is part of what we consider good design for a flashlight application.

Many users are bombarded with advertisements on a daily basis, and whether they believe it or not, this does affect many of
their buying habits. A paid software model allows our users to escape from ads, and can be a better alternative when the
price is fair and low.
